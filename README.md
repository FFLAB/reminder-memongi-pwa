# Reminder PWA

#### By **Phil Mass**

## Description

_This progressive web app keeps track of a user's upcoming events in a list, with the ability to add, edit, or delete events. The background color indicates how soon the event is from the current date. It is intended as a simpler alternative to a calendar. You can scroll through and edit events with either touch or a mouse._

_Because it conforms to the progressive web app (PWA) standard, it can be installed like a native app on Android phones. The PWA standard describes web apps that are optimized for mobile and can work offline_

_You can see the deployed app and install it on your phone [here](https://philrmass.github.io/reminder-pwa/)._
